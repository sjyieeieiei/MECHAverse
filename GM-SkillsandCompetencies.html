        <h2>Upholding Mechanical Engineering Versatility</h2>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Mechanical Engineers are not just merely professionals that designs and innovates practical machinery. They are more than the profession itself, as they possess innumerable traits that make them flexible and versatile in the field of expertise. All these were proven by the ME skills and competencies provided further below.</p>

                <p><b>Creativity.</b> Mechanical engineers design and build complex pieces of equipment and machinery. A creative mind is essential for this kind of work.</p>

                <p><b>Listening Skills.</b> Mechanical engineers often work on projects with others, such as architects and computer scientists. They must listen to and analyze different approaches made by other experts to complete the task at hand.</p>
    
                <p><b>Math Skills.</b> Mechanical engineers use the principles of calculus, statistics, and other advanced subjects in :math for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.</p>
    
                <p><b>Mechanical Skills.</b> Mechanical skills allow engineers to apply basic engineering concepts and mechanical processes to the design of new devices and systems.</p>
    
                <p><b>Problem-solving Skills</b>. Mechanical engineers need good problem-solving skills to take scientific principles and discoveries and use them to design and build useful products.</p>
    
                <p><b>Persevering Prowers.</b> Mechanical engineers are intensely driven and determined. Their tenacity and perseverance enabled them to complete a college degree in a rigorous engineering field that requires mathematical ability, mechanical aptitude and scientific understanding. </p>
    
                <p><b>Focusing Skills.</b> MEs immerse themselves in projects, diligently consider all possibilities and move forward decisively. Thus, this is the reason as to why they are characterised as professionals  that are focused, goal oriented, and intrinsically motivated.</p>
    
                <p><b>Analytical Thinking Skills.</b> Mechanical engineers are logical thinkers who view the world through a rational lens. Naturally curious, they gravitate to puzzles and problems that require abstract thinking. Their personal characteristics come in handy when troubleshooting equipment failures or fixing malfunctions in a new prototype.</p>
