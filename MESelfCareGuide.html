                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Engineering is, undoubtedly, a stressful career path to undertake due to the complexity of the job at hand, the requirement to keep up with ever-changing technical knowledge, and the pressures associated with the end-result of the work being carried out.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">With this in mind, it may not come as a surprise to learn that mental health in engineering is nearing a crisis point. In light of the added stresses from the Covid-19 pandemic, mental health awareness is more important now than ever. If you study full-time as a BSME student or work as professional ME in the technical field, it’s essential that you take steps to protect your emotional wellbeing. With that in mind, here are some mental health engineering tips.
                    </p>

                        <b>Handle Imposter Syndrome.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Imposter syndrome is commonly felt by high-performing individuals and occurs when they start to doubt their professional capabilities or begin to feel inadequate within their workplace and/or role. It’s easy for this to eat away at your confidence and have a negative effect on your mental health. Remind yourself of your qualifications and the fact that you are where you are based on your professional merits, meaning there’s no need to feel inadequate. If a mistake happens, try not to let it spiral and instead tell yourself that you’re only human and mistakes happen. Learning to control imposter syndrome can have a big impact on your overall mental wellbeing, so focus your energy here where possible.</p>
                    
                    <b>Take breaks.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Many MEs are guilty of not taking their allotted breaks, especially those in the technical field, but if you want to avoid burnout and preserve your mental health, make sure you take your full lunch break and leave your work at work.</p>

                    <b>Have Time for friends and family.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Your loved ones usually feel the brunt of your mental health problems, but they’re also typically the ones who can help the most. If you’re struggling, talk to them about how you’re feeling and make an effort to spend quality time with them.
                            </p>

                        <b>Exercise.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Exercise is a proven way to boost endorphins and lower stress levels, so make a real effort to get active. That could be a 10-minute walk or a 60-minute gym session – whatever works best for you. Remember, any movement is better than no movement, and it all makes a difference.</p>

                        <b>Hobbies and passions</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Everyone has hobbies and passions outside of work, but a lot of engineers get so caught up in their day jobs that they forget to relax and unwind, mostly because they don’t have the time. If you feel like all you’re doing is working, your mental health will suffer. With this in mind, make a conscious effort to reserve time to do something you enjoy at least once a week.</p>

                        <b>Stay organized and set priorities.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">One way to reduce stress is to stay organized and set priorities. Make a list of what needs to be done and tackle the most critical tasks first. This will help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done.
                            </p>

                        <b>Ask for help by delegating tasks.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Delegate tasks when possible, supposing you’re feeling overwhelmed, delegate tasks to others on your team. This will help lighten your workload and allow you to focus on the most critical tasks.</p>

                        <b>Don’t try to do everything yourself.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Trying to do everything yourself is a recipe for disaster. Learn to ask for help when needed and accept that you can’t do everything alone. Asking for help shows strength, not weakness!</p>

                        <b>Consult a professional.</b>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Seek professional help if you struggle to cope with work-related stress. A therapist can help you identify and manage the source of your focus to feel better at work and in life.
